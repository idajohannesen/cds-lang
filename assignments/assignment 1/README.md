# Assignment 1
This code loops through every text file in the input folder, which are texts from the Uppsala Student English Corpus, and extracts certain linguistics features of every text. It extracts the relative frequency of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs per 10,000 words and the number of unique locations, persons, and organisations mentioned. These features have been gathered in a pandas dataframe for every subfolder.

The code can be found in the src folder, named 'assignment1.ipynb'.
The csv files can be found in the output folder.
The corpus data can be found in the input folder.
