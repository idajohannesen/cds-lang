This code trains two classification models on a fake news dataset. The notebook is split into three sections with a function each: the first is a vectorizer, the second is a logistic regression, and the third is a neural network. All three functions can be found in the assignment2.py script. 

Each of the models' classification reports are saved as text files in the 'output' folder. The trained models and the vectorizer are saved in the 'models' folder. The reports and models are saved as part of their respective scripts.

Setup requires running the setup.sh script
