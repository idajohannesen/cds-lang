Short description:
This code calculates how many songs from a given artist include words related to an input word. It takes both the artist and input word as arguments which can be decided by the user when running the code.

Data:
The dataset is a corpus of lyrics from 57,650 English-language songs. It can be found as a csv file in the input folder. 
The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/57651-spotify-songs

Reproducing:
The code can be run through the command line by inputting "python assignment3.py -i [word input] -a [artist]". A setup file has been included which should be run first to create a virtual environment with the necessary requirements. The artist must be part of the dataset.
