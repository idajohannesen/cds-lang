Short description: 
This code goes over the results of using CodeCarbon to track CO₂ emissions in the previous assignments. A plot is created for every script used in an assignment, as well as a plot for the overall emissions of every assignment.

Data:
The data consists of results from tracking the emissions of CO₂ from all four previous assignments using CodeCarbon. The code used to track is therefore found in the respective assignment's .py script(s). 
The dataset is therefore the csv files generated by CodeCarbon which can be found in the input folder. All of the existing assignments are set to add to this folder when running the tracker. There is an ```emissions.csv``` file for all assignments' total emissions tracked together, and every assignment script has an additional csv file tracking the individual tasks.

Reproducing:
A setup file has been included which can be run to create a virtual environment with the necessary requirements. The script requires that the csv files with the emission data are located in the input folder. The code can be run by running the individual cells in the Jupyter notebook in order. 

Discussion/summary:
Discussion of the results can be found in the notebook itself.
